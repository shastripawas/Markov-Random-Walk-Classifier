# Markov Random Walk Classifier 
A semi-supervised learning algorithm based on the probabilistic transitions in a markov chain <br>
This is a simple but powerful algorithm to solve the problem of classification of tabular data with very less amount of labelled training data.

## Requirements
The development environment is python (>3.70) with following required libraries: <br>
1.numpy <br>
2.pandas <br>
3.sklearn <br>
4.imblearn  <br>
5.matplotlib  <br>
6.seaborn  <br>


## Usage
Upload the data to be tested in csv format in the following notebook.The input csv file should have labels in the last column.<br> Execute the subsequent cells to obtain the classification report. <br>
The cells at the last provide a comparative analysis (if required) with traditional ML algorithms.
